Analysis of Summary Statistics for Key Numeric Columns
The summary statistics provide an overview of the dataset's numerical features: price, num_subscribers, num_reviews, and content_duration. Here's the interpretation of each:

1. Price
Count: Total number of courses analyzed.
Mean: The average price of courses.
Std: The standard deviation indicates the variability of course prices. High variability suggests a wide range of pricing.
Min: The lowest-priced course, likely free.
25% (Q1): 25% of the courses are priced below this value.
50% (Median): Half the courses are priced below this value, giving insight into the central tendency of prices.
75% (Q3): 75% of the courses are priced below this value.
Max: The highest-priced course.
Insight:
If the minimum is 0, free courses are included.
A significant difference between Q1 and Q3 suggests skewness in pricing, potentially due to promotional strategies or niche content.

2. Number of Subscribers
Count: Total courses with subscriber data.
Mean: Average number of subscribers per course.
Std: High standard deviation suggests a few courses dominate in popularity.
Min: The least-subscribed course has zero subscribers.
25%, 50%, 75% (Quartiles): The distribution of subscriber counts. A significant difference between Q3 and Q1 indicates high variability.
Max: The most-subscribed course.
Possible Insight:
High variability and a skewed distribution might indicate that a few courses attract the majority of users (e.g., popular or free courses).
3. Number of Reviews
Count: Total courses with review data.
Mean: Average number of reviews per course.
Std: High standard deviation indicates significant differences in user engagement.
Min, Q1, Q3, Max: Provide a range of user engagement levels.
Possible Insight:

Similar to subscribers, a skewed review distribution suggests that top courses receive disproportionately higher engagement.
4. Content Duration
Count: Total courses with duration information.
Mean: Average course duration in hours.
Std: A high standard deviation suggests varying course lengths.
Min: The shortest course duration.
Max: The longest course duration.

Insight:
Courses with higher durations might cater to advanced topics, while shorter ones are likely introductory or specific.

General Observations
Correlation Between Variables:
- Free or low-priced courses might attract more subscribers.
- Courses with high subscriber counts may have higher review counts.
- Duration may or may not influence subscribers or reviews, depending on the target audience.

Price Clustering:
- Low-priced or free courses may dominate, reflecting the common Udemy pricing strategy of offering discounts or promotions.

Engagement Metrics:
- The top courses (in subscribers or reviews) are outliers that drive the platformâ€™s popularity.
